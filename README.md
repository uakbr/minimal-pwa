This is the minimal set of files for a "progressive web app" to be installable on Android and iOS.

It contains the smallest possible `manifest.json` and service worker to trigger the install flow on Chrome.

An even smaller implementation that fits in a single HTML file is in [single-file-pwa.html](./single-file-pwa.html). It has a manifest.json that is dynamically generated from JavaScript, and it is installable without a service worker.

## Features

### Countdown Timer
A beautiful, customizable countdown timer that tracks days, hours, minutes, and seconds until your special event.

### Notifications
Enable periodic reminders to check your countdown progress:
- **Customizable Frequency**: Choose how often you want reminders (daily, every 3 days, weekly, every 2 weeks, or monthly)
- **Smart Scheduling**: Uses the Periodic Background Sync API when available, with a fallback for broader browser compatibility
- **Easy Control**: Enable or disable notifications directly from the countdown settings

To use notifications:
1. Open the countdown customization dialog
2. Check "Enable countdown reminders"
3. Select your preferred reminder frequency
4. Click Save and grant notification permissions when prompted

## Deployment

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) that publishes the contents of the project root to GitHub Pages. Pushes to the `main` branch (or manual runs via the workflow dispatch) will build the site and deploy it.

To get the site live:
1. In your repository, open **Settings â†’ Pages** and select **GitHub Actions** as the source.
2. Push to `main` (or re-run the latest deployment workflow) and wait for the `Deploy to GitHub Pages` job to finish.

Once complete, GitHub will expose the PWA at your repository's Pages URL, for example `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/`.
